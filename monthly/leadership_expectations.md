# Leadership Expectations

While all freeCodeCamp Nashville leadership is expected to respect the [CODE OF CONDUCT](../general/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) there are expectations specific to the monthly meeting.

## Monthly Meetup Leadership Expectations

- Attend at least half of the monthly meetings per year.
- Present at least 3 times per year (can be less if presentation schedule is full).
- Organize and manage at least one Meetup per year that features a guest speaker/panel.
- Regular observance and interaction in the #freecodecamp channel on the [NashDev](https://nashdev.com) Slack network.
- Regular observance and interacting in the [fcc_nashville](https://bit.ly/fccNash-discord) Discord server.
- Participation in leadership meetings when they happen (typically no more than 1 per month but usually less than that).
